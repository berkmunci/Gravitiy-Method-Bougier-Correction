# Gravity Method Bougier Correction
## Project Target:
In gravity method which is a geophysical survey, obtain of bougier anomaly data from raw gravity data with helping of correction operations.
## Required Data for satisfy project target: 
for each point: longitude, latitude, raw gravity data (mGal), elevation (m), topography correction values.
## Desired Outputs: 
Contour maps of raw gravity data and bouguer anomaly data
## Project Phases:
  ##  1) DATA COLLECTION PHASE
  - A private dataset(.dat file) which includes Longitude, latitude, raw gravity data (mGal), elevation (m), topography correction values is used. 
  ##  2) DATA PREPERATION PHASE
  - Dataset is imported as dataframe and data type is checked for mathematical operations.
  ##  3) DATA PROCESSING AND VISUALIZATION PHASE
  - Correction operations are defined and applied on raw data. Bouguer data is created and gridded.
  - Desired output is created.<br/>
